# Problem Statement
✔ Determine the most sought-after FinTech products in Nigeria by evaluating average fees and preferred services.

# Insights
Different FinTech products have varying transaction fees. Payment Processing has the highest fees, while Blockchain and Digital Savings have the lowest.

Higher interest rates likely contribute to their lower adoption, especially among price-sensitive users.

The data highlights that mobile apps dominate service delivery, aligning with the insight that young urban professionals and freelancers prefer mobile apps and digital payments for fast transactions.

The dashboard shows Opay has the highest user activity (40M users), which aligns with the statement about its dominance.

large portion of users are novices (57.14%), supporting the claim that Opay’s user base consists of many new or less-experienced users.\

The dashboard shows intermediate (21.43%) and expert (21.43%) users are relatively low, which contrasts with the claim that moderate users dominate the space (61.97%).
# Recommendations
Traditional fintech companies should introduce freemium or subscription-based perks to attract users who prefer zero-fee banking like Kuda.

For transaction-based models, offering tiered pricing or discounts for frequent users can improve retention.

Since rural users rely on these channels, fintech firms should scale up agent networks and optimize USSD services to serve areas with poor internet access.

Some products with high downloads have low engagement. Companies should analyze drop-off points in the user journey and address pain points through better UI/UX design and customer support.

The dashboard largely supports the external insights provided, but it also highlights gaps in financial literacy, engagement, and service delivery to rural users. Addressing these areas can unlock new opportunities for fintech companies in Nigeria.
